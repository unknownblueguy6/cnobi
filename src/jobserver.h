  ///
  /// - An "invalid" value (the default), used to indicate errors, e.g.
  ///   that no slot could be acquired from the pool.
  ///
  /// - The "implicit" value, used to model the job slot that is implicitly
  ///   assigned to a jobserver client by the parent process that spawned
  ///   it.

  ///   the slot pool's pipe (for Posix), or a semaphore decrement operation
  ///   (for Windows).
